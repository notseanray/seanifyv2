#### seanify v2

After creating an actual functioning (yet barebones) streaming service with a backend + client I have learned that using websockets for everything complicates things, especially with the way I had things laid out. Therefore I am rewriting this to use a REST api.

Currently this repo is essentially blank, but that is hopefully soon to change.
